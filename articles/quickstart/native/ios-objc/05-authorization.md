Many identity providers will supply access claims, like roles or groups, with the user. You can request these in your token by setting `scope: openid roles` or `scope: openid groups`. However, not every identity provider provides this type of information. Fortunately, Auth0 has an alternative to it, which is creating a rule for assigning different roles to different users.

## Create a Rule to Assign Roles

To create a rule, just go to theÂ [new rule page](${manage_url}/#/rules/new). You can create it from scratch or use an existing template.  These templates are written by Auth0 team to assist you complete common tasks.

First, you will create a rule that assigns your users either an `admin` role, or a single `user` role. To do so, go to the [new rule page](${manage_url}/#/rules/new) and select the "*Set Roles To A User*" template, under *Access Control*. Then, replace this line from the default script:

```
if (user.email.indexOf('@example.com') > -1)
```

to match the condition that fits your needs. Notice that you can also set more roles other than `admin` and `user`, or customize the whole rule as you please.

By default, it says that if a user email contains `@example.com`, that user will be given an `admin` role, otherwise a regular `user` role.

## Test the Rule

```swift
import Auth0
```

```swift
Auth0
    .users(token: idToken)
    .get(userId, fields: ["app_metadata"], include: true)
    .start { result in
        switch result {
        case .success(let user):
            guard
              let appMetadata = user["app_metadata"] as? [String: Any],
              let roles = appMetadata["roles"] as? [String]
            else {
              // Test failed, make sure you've configured your rule properly (check step 1 thoroughly)
              return
            }
            if roles == "admin" {
                // User has admin access, grant them the power.
            } else {
                // Not an admin, deny the user.
            }
        case .failure(let error):
            // Handler error
        }
}
```

## Use the Rule

At this point, you are able to distinguish the users' roles in your app to authorize or deny access to a certain feature.
